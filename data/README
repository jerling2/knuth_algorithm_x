Matrix Format for a "Doubly Linked Matrix" or 2D Linked List.

(special) 'Comment rows' start with '%' and prelude all other rows.

e.g.

% Description: This line is ignored!

(special) The 'size row' is the first non-commented row, and contains the number of cols.

e.g.

% There are ten columns to this matrix.
10
...rest of the rows.

(otherwise) The rest of the rows have the following format: 
col1 col2 col3 ...coln,val1 val2, val3 ... valn

Logically,
(column(s) token),(value(s) token)

Where the large tokens are delimited by a comma,
and the subtokens are delimited by a space.

When parsed, the line:
col1 col2 col3 ...coln,val1 val2, val3 ... valn

encodes the row:
Row = (col1, val1), (col2, val2), ... (coln, valn)

e.g.

In the string "theatreegg":

5 6 7 8,t r e e

represents the word "tree".

8 9 10,e g g

represents the word "egg".

3 4 5,e a t

represents the word "eat".

and so on.
